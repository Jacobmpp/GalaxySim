I basic simulation of the orbits of star systems in a galaxy with the possibility of added functionality in the future.
# Controls
\ - Toggle Debug data
</> - Decrease/Increase speed by 1 (,/.)
Shift + </> - Decrease/Increase speed by 5 (configurable)
Click and drag - Move Screen
Scroll Wheel - Zoom
/ - Reset Speed to 1 (configurable)
# Visual data
Color and size are based on the "mass" of the systems
Red debug dot is the fixed center of mass of the galaxy
Galaxy center can be updated live with little slow down, but even though in real life the center of mass of a closed system maintains a constant velocity (initially 0)
the live updating center will start moving and launching systems out as the distance becomes very small thus increasing the force.
# Change Policy
Changes are welcome, thou I recommend forking
# Processing Version
This project started in Processing v3.5.4
a java library that greatly eases canvas drawing and hides some file complexity among other things.
